# Optimus Discos for KODI

## Introduction

This is a KODI addon to allow listening to Optimus Discos netlabel catalog
directly from KODI Media Centre.

## Dependencies

It requires script.common.plugin.cache to avoid recurring requests to Optimus
Discos servers.

## Configuration

The addon allows to configure playlist URL (any location complying Optimus
Discos JSON format) and cache duration.

Once Optimus Discos is not updated on a hourly basis a cache is made to speed
up the plugin usage and avoid unnecessary requests to Optimus Discos servers.
